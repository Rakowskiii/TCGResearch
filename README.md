# TCG Research 
Blockchain based system for securing collectible assets with repeatable manufacturing process such as TCGs. 
This repo is a proof of concept for academic research and is not intended for production use.
Many security features were skipped to simplify the implementation and focus on the core functionality.

## Getting Started
The core functionality of the system is based on Ethereum ERC-1155 standard and is implemented using Solidity smart contracts.
Multiple services were built around the smart contract to make interaction easier.
